    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Annie T.H. Le is a second-year student at the University of Missouri,
      studying convergence journalism, political science and sociology.
She first became interested in journalism when she was in high school.
For two years, she was part of the school magazine and eventually became
the online editor for the publication.
During her first year of college, she was involved in MUTV's Creative Team where
she built experience in graphic design and volunteered at KOMU as a production assistant.
She was able to start the journalism program in the beginning of her second year.
For the past 10 months, she was a reporter at Vox Magazine, Flatland KC and Global Journalist.
Her background as a Vietnamese American has inspired her to get involved in free press,
human rights and refugee work.
Besides journalism, Annie is the outgoing internal vice president of the Asian
American Association at MU. She is also the founder and president of the Vietnamese
Student Union and the membership outreach chair for the Midwest Asian American Student Union.
These organizations focus on preserving culture and advocating for those in the
Asian Pacific Islander American and Vietnamese American communities. </p>
